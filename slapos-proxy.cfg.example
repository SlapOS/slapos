# Here goes the list of slapos masters that slapos.proxy is authorized to
#     contact to forward an instance request.
#
# Each section beginning by "multimaster/" is a different SlapOS Master,
#     represented by its URL.
#
# For each section, you need to specify the URL of the SlapOS Master in the
#     section name itself.
#
# For each section, you can specify if needed the location of key/certificate
#     used to authenticate to this slapOS Master.
#
# For each section, you can specify if needed a list of Software Releases,
#     separated by carrier return. Any instance request matching one of those
#     Software Releases will be automatically forwarded to this SlapOS Master
#     and will not be allocated locally.
#
# When doing an instance request, you can specify in filter (a.k.a SLA) a
#     "master_url" that will be used by the slapproxy to forward the request.


# Uncomment the sections bellow to enable multi-master sections, adter set
# your cert/key.
#[multimaster/https://slap.vifib.com]
#key = key file path coming from your slapos master account
#cert = certificate file path coming from your slapos master account
