# Nothing to do for the exporter. This wrapper is intended
# to produce the "dump" files that have to be backed up.
# So, in case of binary DB data, we would back up the ASCII dump
# files, or a similar data format that can be restored on any machine
# (i.e. postgres 'custom')
# In the case of an httpd instance, the src/www directory can be directly
# pulled from the PBS, we don't need to prepare anything.
