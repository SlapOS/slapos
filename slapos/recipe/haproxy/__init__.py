    #      to sleep more time and we can give him work immediately
    # fall should be quite sort. with inter at 3, and fall at 2, a node will be
    #      considered as dead after 6 seconds.

    #      haproxy will manage the queue of request with the possibility to
    #      move a request to another node if the initially selected one is dead
    # maxqueue is the number of waiting request in the queue of every zope client.
    #      It allows to make sure that there is not a zope client handling all
    #      the work while other clients are doing nothing. This was happening
    #      even thoug we have round robin distribution because when a node dies
    #      some seconds, all request are dispatched to other nodes, and then users
    #      stick in other nodes and are not coming back. Please note this option
    #      is not an issue if you have more than (maxqueue * node_quantity) requests
