  # it is useless to have timeout much bigger than the one of apache.
  # By default apache use 300s, so we set slightly more in order to
  # make sure that apache will first stop the connection.

  # Stop waiting in queue for a zope to become available.
  # If no zope can be reached after one minute, consider the request will

  # so we should not set more than 5 seconds, and it could be already too much

  # Use "option forceclose" to not preserve client & server persistent connections
  # while handling every incoming request individually, dispatching them one after
  # another to servers, in HTTP close mode. This is really needed when haproxy
  # is configured with maxconn to 1, without this options browser are unable
  # to render a page
