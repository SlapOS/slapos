console
-------

The slapconsole tool allows to interact with a SlapOS Master throught the SLAP
library.

For more information about SlapOS or slapconsole usages, please go to
http://community.slapos.org.

The slapconsole tool is only a bare Python console with several global variables
defined and initialized.


Initialization and configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Slapconsole allows to automatically connect to a Master using URL and SSL
certificate from given slapos.cfg.
Certificate has to be *USER* certificate, manually obtained from SlapOS master
web interface.

Slapconsole tools reads the given slapos.cfg configuration file and use the
following informations :

 * Master URL is read from [slapos] in the "master_url" parameter.
 * SSL Certificate is read from [slapconsole] in the "cert_file" parameter.
 * SSL Key is read from [slapconsole] in the "key_file" parameter.

See slapos.cfg.example for examples.


Global functions/variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * "request()" is a shorthand for slap.registerOpenOrder().request() allowing
   to request instances.
 * "supply()" is a shorthand for slap.registerSupply().supply() allowing to
   request software installation.

For more information about those methods, please read the SLAP library
documentation.

 * "product" is an instance of slap.SoftwareProductCollection whose only goal is to retrieve
   the URL of the best Software Release of a given Software Product as attribute.
   for each attribute call, it will retrieve from the SlapOS Master the best
   available Software Release URL and return it.

   This allows to request instances in a few words, i.e::

      request("http://www.url.com/path/to/current/best/known/kvm/software.cfg", "mykvm")

   can be simplified into ::

     request(product.kvm, "mykvm")

 * "slap" is an instance of the SLAP library. It is only used for advanced usages.
"slap" instance is obtained by doing ::

  slap = slapos.slap.slap()
  slap.initializeConnection(config.master_url,
    key_file=config.key_file, cert_file=config.cert_file)
    

Examples
~~~~~~~~

::

  >>> # Request instance
  >>> request(product.kvm, "myuniquekvm")

  >>> # Request instance on specific computer
  >>> request(product.kvm, "myotheruniquekvm",
    filter_kw={ "computer_guid": "COMP-12345" })
  
  >>> # Request instance, specifying parameters (here nbd_ip and nbd_port)
  >>> request(product.kvm, "mythirduniquekvm",
    partition_parameter_kw={"nbd_ip":"2a01:e35:2e27:460:e2cb:4eff:fed9:48dc",
    "nbd_port":"1024"})

  >>> # Request software installation on owned computer
  >>> supply(product.kvm, "mycomputer")

  >>> # Fetch existing instance status
  >>> request(product.kvm, "myuniquekvm").getState()

  >>> # Fetch instance information on already launched instance
  >>> request(product.kvm, "myuniquekvm").getConnectionParameter("url")
