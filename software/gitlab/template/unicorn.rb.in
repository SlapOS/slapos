# What to do before we fork a worker
before_fork do |server, worker|
  # XXX why gitlab does not enable this?
  # # the following is highly recomended for Rails + "preload_app true"
  # # as there's no need for the master process to hold a connection
  # defined?(ActiveRecord::Base) and
  #   ActiveRecord::Base.connection.disconnect!

  # The following is only recommended for memory/DB-constrained
  # installations.  It is not needed if your system can house
  # twice as many worker_processes as you have configured.
  #
  # This allows a new master process to incrementally
  # phase out the old master process with SIGTTOU to avoid a
  # thundering herd (especially in the "preload_app false" case)
  # when doing a transparent upgrade.  The last worker spawned
  # will then kill off the old master process with a SIGQUIT.
  old_pid = "#{server.config[:pid]}.oldbin"
  if old_pid != server.pid
    begin
      sig = (worker.nr + 1) >= server.worker_processes ? :QUIT : :TTOU
      Process.kill(sig, File.read(old_pid).to_i)
    rescue Errno::ENOENT, Errno::ESRCH
    end
  end
  #
  # Throttle the master from forking too quickly by sleeping.  Due
  # to the implementation of standard Unix signal handlers, this
  # helps (but does not completely) prevent identical, repeated signals
  # from being lost when the receiving process is busy.
  # sleep 1
end


# What to do after we fork a worker
after_fork do |server, worker|
  # per-process listener ports for debugging/admin/migrations
  # addr = "127.0.0.1:#{9293 + worker.nr}"
  # server.listen(addr, :tries => -1, :delay => 5, :tcp_nopush => true)

  # XXX why gitlab does not enable this?
  # # the following is *required* for Rails + "preload_app true",
  # defined?(ActiveRecord::Base) and
  #   ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection
  
  # reset prometheus client, this will cause any opened metrics files to be closed
  #defined?(::Prometheus::Client.reinitialize_on_pid_change) &&
  #  Prometheus::Client.reinitialize_on_pid_change

  # if preload_app is true, then you may also want to check and
  # restart any other shared sockets/descriptors such as Memcached,
  # and Redis.  TokyoCabinet file handles are safe to reuse
  # between any number of forked children (assuming your kernel
  # correctly implements pread()/pwrite() system calls)
