# - lines containing an "=" sign which must fit in the following categorie.
#   - "^\s*filename\s*=\s*path\s*$" where "path" is relative to this file
#     Copied verbatim.
#   - "^\s*hashtype\s*=.*" where "hashtype" is one of the values supported

#     Re-generated.
# - other lines are copied verbatim
# Substitution (${...:...}), extension ([buildout] extends = ...) and
# section inheritance (< = ...) are NOT supported (but you should really
# not need these here).
