PlantUML is a service rendering UML diagrams defined in a simple and intuitive
language.

Each diagram has a unique URL which is made of an encoded version of the
diagram code.

Diagrams can be rendered as png, svg or ascii art text.

See http://plantuml.com/PlantUML_Language_Reference_Guide.pdf for a full
reference on the diagram language.
