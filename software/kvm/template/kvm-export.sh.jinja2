# Due to the way qmp works, the VM file cannot be compressed on the fly.
# Although the compression step is optional, the importer uses the .gz file
# if present. So, remove it if you are disabling the compression.

# The downside of compression, here, is the temporary usage of more disk space
# in the exporter node. The goal is to minimize disk usage on the PBS server.

# If you want to compress the file in-place:
# truncate -s $(gzip -c $BACKUP_FILE | dd of=$BACKUP_FILE conv=notrunc 2>&1 | sed -n '$ s/ .*$// p') $BACKUP_FILE
# but the importer script would have to be adapted.
