# Make sure that Makefile.in is not older that the other file that is modified
# by the above patch, otherwise `make` would invoke automake, which is likely
# to fail with an error like:
#   This is Automake 1.16.5, but the definition used by this AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
#   comes from Automake 1.16.4.
# Without such pre-configure, the 2 files usually have the same modification
# date because machines are fast, but not always.
