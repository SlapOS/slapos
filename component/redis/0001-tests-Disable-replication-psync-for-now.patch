Subject: [PATCH] tests: Disable replication-psync for now

This tests fails on multi-cpu machine for almost all know Redis version.
A lot of people reported to upstream author and I too provided detailed
feedback about how it fails and on which hardware and offered ssh access
to debug:

https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/2715#issuecomment-151608948

The issue there is already known for ~ 3 months with several people
allowing to help, but so far it remains broken.

Since we don't use Redis replication, for us it is ok to disable the
test and move on.

NOTE comments in tcl don't work inside lists (consruct inside { ... } )-
that's why the entry was moved out.
