# ---- infrastructure to build Go workspaces / projects ----

# gowork is the top-level section that defines Go workspace.
#
# It specifies global settings that are used to build Go programs:
#
# - Go toolchain to use, e.g.
#
#   [gowork]
#   golang = ${golang1.15:location}
#
# - For Cgo support pkg-config is made pre-available by gowork, and users
#   should list paths where to search for pkg-config files, e.g. this way:
#
#   [gowork]
#   cpkgpath =
#       ${sqlite3:location}/lib/pkgconfig
#       ${zlib:location}/lib/pkgconfig
#
# - It is also possible to specify Go build flags used for compilation e.g. this way:
#
#   [gowork]
#   buildflags = -race
#
# - If some environment variables are needed during the build, they can be
#   added with environment option, e.g. this way:
#
#   [gowork]
#   environment =
#     CGO_ENABLED = 1
#     FOO = bar
#
# Users can also add `install` field to [gowork] to request Go programs to be
# automatically installed, for example:
#
#   [gowork]
#   install =
#       lab.nexedi.com/kirr/neo/go/...@v0.0.0-20210103165133-f3effa6c535f
