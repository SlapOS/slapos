# We clone it via golang infrastructure into a Go workspace.
# Via gowork helloweb/go is not only cloned, but also built and installed into gowork/bin.
#
# Another option would be to use slapos.recipe.build:gitclone and handle
# cloning+building manually. However to be able to use third-party Go packages
# we need gowork support, and other languages can use helloweb repository from
# under gowork as well.

# if ruby program is represented as already-released gem, we can install it

# install the program from source-checkout, the Ruby way is to use bundler,
# install program dependencies via it, and run the program itself via it.
#
# Since for helloweb.rb we have source checkout - we go the second - bundler way.
