# if ruby program is represented as already-released gem, we can install it

#
# Alternatively if we need to
# install the program from source-checkout, the Ruby way is to use bundler,
# install program dependencies via it, and run the program itself via it.
#
# Since for helloweb.rb we have source checkout - we go the second - bundler way.
